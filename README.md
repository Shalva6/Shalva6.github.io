So, basically this portfolio is very easy to set up.

First, [get an api key](https://web3forms.com/#start) from Web3Forms, which is a free service to handle form submissions.

Then, get a public api key you received on your mail and replace the 'apiKey' variable in the 'src/data/data.tsx' file with your own key

Then, you have to create the repository with the name of 'your_username.github.io'.

After that, assuming that you have these files on your local machine, you can follow git's instructions to push the files to your repository

Don't forget to activate Github Pages and make Github Actions work on your repository

Finally, you can visit your portfolio at 'https://your_username.github.io'
